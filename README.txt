README file for 
Project 3 Gesture Recognition
by Hantian Liu
“””


1. Run predict.py to recognize the unknown gesture. For each dataset, i.e. .txt file, in the data folder, the algorithm would print out the most possible motion as well as the confidence in its recognition. 

For example, circle17.txt was recognized as circle, with the largest probability, and confidence shown as following
"circle17.txt belongs to the motion of circle    with maximum log likelihood of -1413.94499728    with confidence of 0.963865632441"

Put the test images into “./test_data” subfolder, or change the folder name for test files. 


2. 
To reproduce my training process, run train.py.
Trained model would be saved in local folder.
